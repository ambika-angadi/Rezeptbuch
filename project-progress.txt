Created a new repository "Rezeptbuch" in Github.

13.07.2023
Established protocol. Added the protocol (Rezeptbuch-protocol.pdf) in the assets folder
Designed logo
Home page basic layout finished

14.07.2023
Improved Home page, modified by removing vertical navigation bar
Finished Starters, Main course and Desserts page
I am not sure how to implement Javascript in the website

16.07.2023
Added add_recipe.html where a new recipe is added successfully and the recipe is displayed on the same page after form submit
added code to script.js to open add_recipe.html upon cliking Add a Recipe link on the home page
In the landing page implemented local data storage to save the recipe details
Problem: the recipe is displayed on the add_recipe page upon submission. But it needs to be displayed upon clicking a recipe card in the starters, main course and desserts pages. Working on this further.
Added edit_recipe.html and delete_recipe.html
Added Favourites section
Problem: recipe displaying on the same page not resolved
